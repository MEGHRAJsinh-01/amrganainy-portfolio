# Multi-User Portfolio Platform

This project extends the original portfolio to create a multi-user platform where each user can have their own portfolio.

## 🚀 New Features

### Multi-User Capabilities
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Create accounts with secure authentication
- **User Dashboard**: Each user gets their own dashboard to manage their portfolio
- **Custom Portfolios**: Personalized portfolio for each user with unique URL
- **Admin Management**: Super admin interface to manage all users

### Enhanced User Experience
- **User Profiles**: Detailed user profiles with customization options
- **Project Management**: Advanced project management with categories and tags
- **Analytics**: View portfolio visitor statistics
- **Custom Domains**: Connect custom domains to your portfolio (planned)

## 📋 Implementation Status

This is currently in the UI mockup phase. The following components have been created:

- **Authentication**: Login, Registration, Password Reset
- **User Dashboard**: Portfolio management interface
- **Admin Dashboard**: User management for administrators
- **Public Portfolio View**: How each user's portfolio appears to visitors

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- React Router for navigation
- TailwindCSS for styling
- JWT-based authentication

### Backend (Planned)
- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB for data storage
- Multi-user database schema
- Role-based access control

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Accessing the UI Mockup
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` in the portfolio to show the admin link
2. Click the "Multi-User Platform" button that appears
3. Explore the UI mockup

### Required Dependencies
Before implementing the full functionality, install:
```bash
npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom
```

See the `DEPENDENCIES.md` file for a complete list of required packages.

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

The multi-user platform includes:
- Secure password hashing
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Protected API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization

## 👥 User Roles

- **User**: Can create and manage their own portfolio
- **Admin**: Can manage all users and their portfolios
- **Guest**: Can view public portfolios

## 🌐 Deployment Considerations

When deploying the multi-user platform:
1. Set up proper authentication environment variables
2. Configure database connection settings
3. Implement proper CORS policies
4. Set up file storage solution
5. Configure email service for notifications
