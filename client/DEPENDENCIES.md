# React Router DOM Installation

To make the multi-user platform fully functional, you need to install react-router-dom:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add react-router-dom
```

After installation, you should also add the TypeScript types:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/react-router-dom
```

## Once Installed

After installing react-router-dom, you can uncomment the following line in App.tsx:

```typescript
// import MultiUserApp from './MultiUserApp';
```

And replace the placeholder multi-user platform UI with the actual router-based implementation:

```typescript
if (showMultiUserPlatform) {
    return <MultiUserApp />;
}
```

## Additional Dependencies

For the complete implementation, you may also want to install:

1. For authentication:
```bash
npm install jwt-decode
```

2. For form management:
```bash
npm install react-hook-form
```

3. For API calls:
```bash
npm install axios
```

4. For state management (optional):
```bash
npm install zustand
```
