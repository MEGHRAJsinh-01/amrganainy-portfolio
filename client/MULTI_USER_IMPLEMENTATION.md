# Multi-User Portfolio Platform Implementation Guide

This guide outlines the steps required to transform the existing single-user portfolio into a multi-user platform where each user can have their own portfolio.

## Current Implementation Status

- [x] UI mockup components for authentication (login, registration, password reset)
- [x] UI mockup for user dashboard
- [x] UI mockup for admin dashboard
- [x] UI mockup for user portfolio view
- [x] Placeholder multi-user platform in App.tsx
- [ ] Backend implementation
- [ ] Database schema updates
- [ ] API endpoints for user management
- [ ] Authentication system

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Install Required Dependencies

See the `DEPENDENCIES.md` file for a list of required dependencies.

### 2. Enable the Multi-User App

After installing dependencies, you can enable the full multi-user application by uncommenting the import in `App.tsx` and using the actual `MultiUserApp` component instead of the placeholder.

### 3. Connect to Backend

Update the authentication functions in `MultiUserApp.tsx` to make actual API calls instead of using mock data.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Update Database Schema

Create new collections/tables for:
- Users
- User Profiles
- User Projects
- User CVs
- Settings

### 2. Create API Endpoints

Implement RESTful endpoints for:
- User registration and authentication
- Portfolio management (CRUD operations)
- Admin operations for user management

### 3. Authentication System

Implement JWT-based authentication with:
- User roles (admin, user)
- Secure password storage
- Token refresh mechanism

## Testing the Implementation

### Using the UI Mockup

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` to show the admin link
2. Click the "Multi-User Platform" button that appears
3. Explore the UI mockup

### Once Dependencies are Installed

1. Install react-router-dom and other dependencies
2. Uncomment the MultiUserApp import in App.tsx
3. Update the placeholder code to use the actual MultiUserApp component
4. Use the `Ctrl+Shift+M` keyboard shortcut to toggle between the original portfolio and the multi-user platform

## Future Enhancements

1. User Analytics Dashboard
2. Customizable Portfolio Templates
3. Domain Name Management for Users
4. Integration with More External Services (Dribbble, Behance, etc.)
5. Payment Processing for Premium Features
